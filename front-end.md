# front-end task

You need to create a simple web app in the CodeSandbox editor (https://codesandbox.io/s/vanilla).

App should consist of two buttons: 
* `Get random number` - by clicking on this button, user should see a car with number in range `[10, 20]`.
* `Get current time` - by clicking on this button, user should see a card with pretty-printed current time in the format `HH:mm:ss:SSS`.

A card can be closed by clicking on ‚ùå button inside it.

You can use any library you may find useful - for example, `moment`.

Example of the app:

**Your app shouldn't be absolutely the same as seen in the example - just try to recreate as much functionality and design as possible.**
